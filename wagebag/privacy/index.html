  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective date: <strong>July 6, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>WageBag</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>

    We take your privacy seriously. All your data is stored securely on your device. You are in control of your information, and it is never shared without your consent.
